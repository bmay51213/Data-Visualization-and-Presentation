## The Story Behind Airplane Safety

This project was focused on a hypothetical scenario regarding Airplane Safety and the goal was to utilize different methods of data visualization to effectively tell the data's story using best data visualization practices.

In this scenario, the public has become concerned that airplanes are no longer safe to fly on due to highly publicized airplane crashes.  The media has been broadcasting the statistics indicating that fatalities and accidents have significantly increased in recent years.

The project was broken down into five separate components including:
  1. A Dashboard
  2. Infographic
  3. Blog Post
